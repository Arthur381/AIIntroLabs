# 🌟 Introduction to AI Labs - Solutions & Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) Labs** repository! 🚀 This repository documents my learning experience and solutions for the AI course labs.

## 📂 Lab Structure
This course consists of multiple hands-on labs covering essential AI concepts:

- **[Lab 0](./lab0/)** - Python exercises 🐍
- **[Lab 1](./lab1/)** - Search algorithms 🔍
- **[Lab 2](./lab2/)** - Machine Learning: MLP & Image Recognition 🖼️
- **[Lab 3](./lab3/)** - Machine Learning: Transformers & Sentiment Classification 📝
- **[Lab 4](./lab4/)** - Robotics: Localization & Path Planning 🤖

## 🎯 About This Course
This **Introduction to AI** course was once considered difficult to grade, but after curriculum reforms, it has become an engaging and well-structured course. The labs are thoughtfully designed and **challenging yet rewarding**, making me experience both frustration and joy while working through them.

Since this course is often the **first exposure to AI** for many undergraduate students, I strongly encourage **completing the assignments independently**. Training models and fine-tuning hyperparameters firsthand will deepen your appreciation of the **beauty of AI**. ✨

## 🙌 Purpose of This Repository
The primary goal of this repository is to **document my learning journey**. However, if it can also serve as a helpful resource for others, I would be truly honored! Feel free to explore, but remember: **understanding AI comes best through hands-on experience!** 💡

Happy coding! 🚀
